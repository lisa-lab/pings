Installation Guide
==================

This document will guide you in installing a local copy of the Pings server
for development, etc.

You will need virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper (2.9 or greater) to follow
this guide. On top of Python (obviously), you will need memcached and redis
installed. And finally you will also require the development packages for
libevent and zeromq.

On Ubuntu or Debian, you can install all the above by running first: ``sudo
apt-get install libevent-dev libzmq-dev python-dev python-distribute
memcached redis-server`` and second either ``sudo apt-get install
virtualenvwrapper`` (if running Ubuntu 12.04, Debian wheezy or more recent)
or ``sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper`` (if running an earlier version of
Ubuntu or Debian).

Once you have all the requirements above installed (remember to source
virtualenvwrapper to activate it), the rest is pretty simple.

1. Create and activate a virtualenv project directory (an isolated Python
   installation) by running `mkproject pings`. You can check that the
   virtualenv was activated by running ``showvirtualenv``, which should ouput
   "pings". After executing the ``mkproject`` command, your current directory
   will be the project directory, and all Python packages installed through
   ``pip`` will be kept in a separate location from your system Python packages.

2. Get a copy of the source code into the current directory by running
   ``git clone git://github.com/lisa-lab/pings.git .``

3. Go to the "server" subdirectory of the Pings source code: ``cd pings/server``.

4. To install all the Python dependencies for the Pings, run ``pip install
-r requirements.txt``. This takes a little while.

5. Then run ``python setup.py develop`` to install (in-place) the Pings
server code itself.

6. Run the script ``./download_geoip_db`` to download a copy of the free
GeoIP database from MaxMind.

7. Start the Pings servers. In separate windows, run:
   * ``./storage_server development.ini``
   * ``./leaderboards_server development.ini``
   * ``paster serve development.ini``

You should now have a Pings server running, listening on port 6543.

A few notes. The above assumes that the Redis and Memcache servers
installed are running. If this is not the case, start the missing ones (in
separate windows again) with ``redis-server`` or ``memcached``. If you have
the Screen program installed, you can also use the ``development.screenrc``
file instead, which starts all the above programs (except memcached) in
separate screen windows. Simply to ``screen -c development.screenrc`` to do
that.
