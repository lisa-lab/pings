Installation Guide
==================

This document will guide you in installing a local copy of the Pings server
for development, etc.

You will need virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to follow this guide. On top
of Python (obviously), you will need memcached and redis installed. And
finally you will also require the development packages for libevent and
zeromq.

Once you have all the requirements above installed, the rest is pretty
simple.

1. Create and activate a virtualenv project directory (an isolated Python
   installation) by running `mkproject pings`. You can check that the
   virtualenv was activated by running ``showvirtualenv``, which should ouput
   "pings".

2. Get a copy of the source code by running ``git clone
   git://github.com/lisa-lab/pings.git`` (if this is not already done).

3. Go to the "server" subdirectory of the Pings source code: ``cd pings/server``.

4. To install all the Python dependencies for the Pings, run ``pip install
-r requirements.txt``. This takes a little while.

5. Then run ``python setup.py develop`` to install (in-place) the Pings
server code itself.

6. Run the script ``./download_geoip_db`` to download a copy of the free
GeoIP database from MaxMind.

7. Start the Pings servers. In separate windows, run:
   * ``./storage_server development.ini``
   * ``./leaderboards_server development.ini``
   * ``paster serve development.ini``

You should now have a Pings server running, listening on port 6543.

A few notes. The above assumes that the Redis and Memcache servers
installed are running. If this is not the case, start the missing ones (in
separate windows again) with ``redis-server`` or ``memcached``. If you have
the Screen program installed, you can also use the ``development.screenrc``
file instead, which starts all the above programs (except memcached) in
separate screen windows. Simply to ``screen -c development.screenrc`` to do
that.
